# A11: Prototype and CSS Layout

## Assignment Description
Create an html prototype for your site and update your mockups in preparation of the critique. The html prototype should be clickable between pages and the nav styled in CSS. After the critique, you'll start styling the page content in CSS, so the prototype is meant to give your a head start with the html.

## Instructions
1. Make any changes to your mockups for the critique
  - Save each image as a png and put them in a folder named `a11-mocks`
  - Zip up the folder (right click, create archive) and upload it to the `assignment-11` folder
1. Create the html prototype
  - Create an html file for each page in your tutorial site.
  - Add navigational links and style in css
  - Add your text and image content to each page
1. Turn in

## Requirement Checklist:
- Is there a clickable prototype uploaded? `https://{username}.github.io/web1/assignment-11`
- Are the mocks zipped up and uploaded?
- Check the prototype
  - Are there navigation links to all pages?
  - Are the tutorial steps present in HTML?
  - Does the styled navigation look like the mockups?
- Are the mocks ready for presentation?
