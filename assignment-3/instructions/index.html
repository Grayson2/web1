# Assignment 3: Style About Me

## Assignment Description

1. For each html page, add a link to the stylesheet
  - Add a link tag within the head section:
  `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">`
1. Find what each page should look like in the [instructions/mockups](mockups/) folder
1. Find the style specifications (specs) in the [instructions/specs](specs/) folder
1. Follow the specs to add classes to the html
  - `<div>` becomes `<div class="hero">`
1. Follow the specs to style the classes in css
  - in style.css:
  ```
  .hero {
    background-color: #16445f;
    text-align: center;
    overflow: auto;
  }
```
